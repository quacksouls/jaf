# Exercises

**Exercise 1.** In 1989, John Hughes published a classic paper outlining some
reasons for adopting FP. The 2 main reasons given in the paper are higher-order
functions and lazy evaluation, both of which Hughes argued contribute to
modularity. [Read Hughes' paper here](https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/32.2.98).

**Exercise 2.** In a 2015 follow-up to Hughes' paper, Zhenjiang Hu _et al._
reviewed the impact of FP with an emphasis on how it contributes to the
correctness, structuring, and reasoning about computation.

**Exercise 3.** The papers by
[John Hughes](https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/32.2.98) and
[Zhenjiang Hu _et al._](https://doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwv042) were written for an
academic audience and can be difficult to read/understand. Search online for
articles that explain the reasoning for adopting FP, but written in a style you
can appreciate. Here are some articles you might find interesting:

**Exercise 4.** [James Sinclair](https://jrsinclair.com/) wrote a series of blog
posts about JavaScript FP. Browse through the various posts to see which ones
catch your interest.

**Exercise 5.** The npm module
[`functional-javascript-workshop`](https://github.com/timoxley/functional-javascript-workshop)
presents JavaScript FP in a workshop format. Each tutorial in the workshop
presents an FP concept, followed by a problem for you to solve in JavaScript FP.
Install and load the module. Use the workshop to consolidate your understanding
and working knowledge of JavaScript FP.
